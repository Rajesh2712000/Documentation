CORE WEB VITALS :
 =>Core Web Vitals are a set of specific factors that Google considers important in a webpage's overall user experience. 
 
 main three types:
 *CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)
 *FID (First Input Delay)
 *LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)
 
 
 what is cls?
 => CLS is a measure of the largest burst of layout shift scores for every unexpected layout shift that occurs during the entire lifespan of a page.
 to calculate cls:
      layout shift score = impact fraction * distance fraction
         impact fraction:
             *The union of the visible areas of all unstable elements for the previous frame and the current frame—as a fraction of the total area of the viewport—is the impact fraction for the current frame.
         distance fraction:
             *The distance fraction is the greatest distance any unstable element has moved in the frame (either horizontally or vertically) divided by the viewport's largest dimension (width or height, whichever is greater).
 First Input Delay:
           * It is the length of time, in milliseconds, between the first user interaction on a web page and the browser's response to that interaction. Scrolling and zooming are not included in this metric.
Largest Contentful Paint: 
           * The Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) metric reports the render time of the largest image or text block visible within the viewport, relative to when the page first started loading.
